; Custom NSIS hooks for Moxie.
;
; 1) Adds an "Open with Moxie" entry to the right-click menu of folders, so a
;    whole directory can be opened as a workspace straight from Explorer.
; 2) Makes uninstall SURGICAL: it removes only the files we installed, so a file
;    the user saved inside the install folder (e.g. a Markdown note next to the
;    app) is preserved instead of being wiped by a blanket "RMDir /r $INSTDIR".
;
; Registry entries are written under HKCU\Software\Classes (per-user) so they
; work without admin rights, matching the per-user install.

!macro customInstall
  ; Clean up the legacy entry from the pre-Moxie app name.

; Replaces electron-builder's default "RMDir /r $INSTDIR" — which would wipe the
; WHOLE install folder. Because the install directory is now user-selectable
; (allowToChangeInstallationDirectory), a user might install into a folder that
; also holds their own files. So removal is SURGICAL in BOTH cases — update and
; real uninstall — deleting only the files we shipped. The wildcard deletes cover
; Electron's entire payload (exe, *.dll/*.pak/*.bin/*.dat, locales/, resources/
; incl. app.asar, swiftshader/), so updates still get a clean slate; anything the
; user added (notes, etc.) is left untouched, and the final non-recursive RMDir
; removes the folder only if it ends up empty.
